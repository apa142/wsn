## Wireless Sensor Network
It is a simple code for node deployment in wireless sensor network
The code can be used for performing sensor network deployment in which there are a specific number of nodes in a grid. 
Here, the number of nodes is 100 and the grid is 400 x 400, it is possible to change the parameter accordingly and also use in your network as function.
